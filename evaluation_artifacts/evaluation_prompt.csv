1|Which regions support spot instances for training?|Managed Spot Training can be used with all instances supported in Amazon SageMaker. Managed Spot Training is supported in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker is currently available.|all AWS regions
2|Does SageMaker provide any free ML environments?|SageMaker includes the following machine learning environments:  SageMaker Canvas: An auto ML service that gives people with no coding experience the ability to build models and make predictions with them. SageMaker Studio:   An integrated machine learning environment where you can build, train, deploy, and analyze your models all in the same application. SageMaker Studio Lab: A free service that gives customers access to AWS compute resources in an environment based on open-source JupyterLab. RStudio on Amazon SageMaker: An integrated development environment for R, with a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.|Yes, SageMaker Studio Lab provides a free service that gives customers access to AWS compute resources in an environment based on open-source JupyterLab.
3|What are some of the ways to access JumpStart?|SageMaker JumpStart provides pretrained, open-source models for a wide range of problem types to help you get started with machine learning. You can incrementally train and tune these models before deployment. JumpStart also provides solution templates that set up infrastructure for common use cases, and executable example notebooks for machine learning with SageMaker. You can access the pretrained models, solution templates, and examples through the JumpStart landing page in Amazon SageMaker Studio. You can also access JumpStart models using the SageMaker Python SDK.|You can access the pretrained models, solution templates, and examples through the JumpStart landing page in Amazon SageMaker Studio and the SageMaker Python SDK.
4|Can Ground Truth help me save my labelling costs? If so, how?|To train a machine learning model, you need a large, high-quality, labeled dataset. You can label your data using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Choose from one of the Ground Truth built-in task types or create your own custom labeling workflow. To improve the accuracy of your data labels and reduce the total cost of labeling your data, use Ground Truth enhanced data labeling features like automated data labeling and annotation consolidation. |Yes, Ground Truth can help you save your labelling costs by using features like automated data labelling and annotation consolidation.
5|Which SageMaker feature can help me prepare my datasets for model training?|To analyze data and evaluate machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker, use Amazon SageMaker Processing. With Processing, you can use a simplified, managed experience on SageMaker to run your data processing workloads, such as feature engineering, data validation, model evaluation, and model interpretation. Your input data must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Alternatively, you can use Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift as input sources.|Amazon SageMaker Processing can help you analyze and process your data.
6|Can SageMaker alert me if a model's accuracy goes down?|Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production. You can set up continuous monitoring with a real-time endpoint (or a batch transform job that runs regularly), or on-schedule monitoring for asynchronous batch transform jobs. With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations in the model quality. Model Monitor provides the following types of monitoring: Monitor drift in data quality, Monitor drift in model quality metrics, such as accuracy. Monitor bias in your model's predictions, Monitor drift in feature attribution.|Yes, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor can alert you if a model's accuracy goes down.
7|Who is responsible for data security?|Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud: Security of the cloud – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Security in the cloud – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations. |AWS and the customer
8|How can I track who made a SageMaker API call?|Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of SageMaker and your other AWS solutions. AWS provides the following monitoring tools: Amazon CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. Amazon CloudWatch Logs enables you to monitor, store, and access your log files. AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account. CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. |AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account.
